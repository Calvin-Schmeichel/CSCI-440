- Want to set up a similar format to the example shown in class.
- ASCII Art in the terminal to represent the Map + Creatures.
- (Might switch if its too complicated)
- Creatures will have 2 genders and need one of each to reproduce.

### Summary

Overall this was a fun project to think about conceptually. The actual implementation was harder then I expected.

I used Python and the Terminal + ASCII art for the project. Looking back using something like unity might have worked a bit better. But this did lead to a unique look.
