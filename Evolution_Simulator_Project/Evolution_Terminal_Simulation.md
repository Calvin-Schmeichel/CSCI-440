# Evolution Terminal Simulation

[Chat with ChatGPT 4.0](https://chat.openai.com/share/eef45ead-8d48-4644-a29b-a3eb02ec815d)

Original Description of Project:

## Descriptions

- Plan to use Python
- Want to set up a similar format to the example shown in class.
- ASCII Art in the terminal to represent the Map + Creatures.
- (Might switch if its too complicated)
- Creatures will have 2 genders and need one of each to reproduce.
- There will be 2 main statuses (Hungry and Looking for mate)
and a third idle status which is walking when no-one is around.

### Summary

Overall this was a fun project to think about conceptually. The actual implementation was harder then I expected.

I used Python and the Terminal + ASCII art for the project. Looking back using something like unity might have worked a bit better. But this did lead to a unique look.

### Game Screen Shot

### Issues

Some issues I ran into was accurately explaining to ChatGPT the project deliverables and the logic I was trying to create. The other issue was explaining bugs for the AI to fix.

As you can see from the screen shot for example we see the number of creatures is off (Only 2 creatures on screen vs 5).

Another one was creatures spawning randomly across the field. (VS close by the parents.)

### Ending

So in the end the the code is "-working- code" aka it is in a state that runs. But it does not work great, but it *does* run.
