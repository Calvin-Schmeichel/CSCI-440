# TicTacToe

### Overview

This was a fun project to work on. We did get some example code to work off of but I decided to start from scratch. I wanted to use the same tools and language mentioned in the example so I stuck with Python and TKinter.

This was great for me since I am a bit familiar with both tools from my CYB 301 course. This project took me about 1 hour to complete with about ~7 code iterations from ChatGPT 4.0. Only the first batch of code provided me with an error while each iteration after worked great as I added more features to the program.

The only main issue I can into was that there was visual issues when drawing the game board on MacOS but on my Windows 11 VM it worked great. Not sure if its a display driver issue or my installed version of TKinter on the Mac.

This was a great project to work on and I learned more about the features of TKinter.
